# QA Incident Resolution Report

## Incident Summary

**Incident ID:** PROD-2025-001  
**Date Reported:** 2025-01-05  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Status:** Resolved  
**Reporter:** Production Monitoring Team  
**Assignee:** Engineering Team  

## Issue Description

The production website for Ghanabuild.AI (https://ghanabuild.ai) was displaying only a static screenshot instead of the interactive React application. Users were unable to access the functional cost estimation tool, rendering the service completely unusable.

## Investigation Timeline

### Initial Detection
- **Time:** 2025-01-05 08:00 UTC
- **Source:** User reports and production monitoring alerts
- **Symptoms:** Website loading static image instead of interactive application

### Investigation Phase
- **Time:** 2025-01-05 08:15 UTC  
- **Actions Taken:**
  1. Verified deployment status on hosting platform
  2. Checked build artifacts and deployment logs
  3. Examined DNS and CDN configuration
  4. Reviewed recent code changes and deployment history

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues Identified

1. **Build Configuration Problems:**
   - PostCSS configuration conflicts between ESM modules and CommonJS
   - Tailwind CSS plugin incompatibility causing build failures
   - Missing or incorrect dependencies in production environment

2. **Deployment Pipeline Issues:**
   - Build process was failing silently in CI/CD pipeline
   - Fallback mechanism was serving a static screenshot instead of proper error handling
   - Lack of proper build validation before deployment

3. **Monitoring Gaps:**
   - No automated health checks for the application functionality
   - Missing alerts for build failures in deployment pipeline
   - Insufficient monitoring of user-facing application features

## Resolution Steps

### Immediate Actions (2025-01-05 09:00 UTC)
1. **Fixed Build Configuration:**
   - Removed conflicting PostCSS configuration files
   - Resolved Tailwind CSS plugin compatibility issues
   - Ensured proper dependency management for production builds

2. **Updated Deployment Process:**
   - Re-ran build process with corrected configuration
   - Verified successful compilation of React application
   - Deployed working build to production environment

3. **Validation:**
   - Confirmed React application loads correctly
   - Tested all interactive features (form submission, cost estimation)
   - Verified responsive design across multiple devices

### Post-Resolution Actions
1. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Implemented application health checks
   - Added build pipeline failure notifications
   - Set up synthetic transaction monitoring for key user flows

2. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Created this incident resolution report
   - Updated README with development and deployment guidelines
   - Added troubleshooting section for common build issues

## Technical Details

### Build Configuration Changes
```javascript
// Removed conflicting PostCSS configurations
// Updated package.json dependencies
// Ensured proper Tailwind CSS CDN usage in HTML
```

### Dependencies Resolved
- Fixed Tailwind CSS plugin incompatibilities
- Updated build scripts for production environment
- Ensured proper ESM module handling

## Impact Assessment

### Business Impact
- **Downtime:** Approximately 2 hours of degraded service
- **Users Affected:** All website visitors during incident window
- **Revenue Impact:** Complete loss of new user acquisitions during downtime
- **Reputation Impact:** Potential negative user experience for first-time visitors

### Technical Impact
- **System Availability:** 0% functional availability during incident
- **Data Loss:** None (no user data was affected)
- **Security Impact:** None identified

## Prevention Measures

### Short-term (Implemented)
1. **Enhanced Build Validation:**
   - Added pre-deployment smoke tests
   - Implemented proper error handling in deployment pipeline
   - Added build artifact validation

2. **Monitoring Improvements:**
   - Real-time application health monitoring
   - Automated alerting for build failures
   - User journey monitoring for critical paths

### Long-term (Planned)
1. **Infrastructure Improvements:**
   - Implement blue-green deployment strategy
   - Add automated rollback mechanisms
   - Enhance staging environment to better mirror production

2. **Process Improvements:**
   - Mandatory code review for build configuration changes
   - Regular dependency audits and updates
   - Comprehensive documentation for deployment procedures

## Lessons Learned

1. **Build Configuration Complexity:**
   - Modern JavaScript build tools require careful configuration management
   - Dependencies between CSS frameworks and build tools need thorough testing
   - Version compatibility issues can cause silent failures

2. **Monitoring and Alerting:**
   - Application-level monitoring is as important as infrastructure monitoring
   - Build pipeline failures must trigger immediate alerts
   - User-facing functionality requires continuous validation

3. **Deployment Safety:**
   - Always validate builds in staging environments
   - Implement proper fallback mechanisms instead of serving screenshots
   - Automated testing should cover the entire user experience
