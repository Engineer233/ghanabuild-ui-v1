# Site Not Ready Screenshot

This placeholder image represents the issue where the Ghanabuild.AI production website was displaying only a static screenshot instead of the interactive React application.

**Issue:** The website showed a non-functional static image rather than the working cost estimation tool.

**Resolution:** Fixed build configuration and deployment pipeline issues as documented in the QA incident resolution report.

**Image Note:** This is a placeholder PNG file representing the static screenshot that was incorrectly served to users. The actual screenshot would have shown the Ghanabuild.AI interface but without any interactive functionality.
