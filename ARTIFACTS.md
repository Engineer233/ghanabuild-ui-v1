# Build and QA Artifacts

All build logs, test outputs, and UI screenshots are uploaded as artifacts to GitHub Actions for every PR and push to `main`.

## How to Access

Artifacts can be accessed from the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository after each workflow run. Download links will appear in the summary of each workflow run.
