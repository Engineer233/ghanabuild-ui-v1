@copilot Please ensure the following steps are fully implemented in this PR:

1. Install and save `framer-motion` dependency:
   → `npm install framer-motion`

2. Add missing devDependencies for Tailwind and PostCSS to fix build errors:
   → `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`

3. Ensure `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` are properly configured.

4. Replace Tailwind CDN with proper import in main CSS (e.g., `index.css`):
   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

5. Verify that Vercel build and deployment now pass without error and the site is fully functional.

Once completed, please mark this PR as **Ready for Review** and I’ll proceed to merge.
